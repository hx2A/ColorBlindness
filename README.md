# ColorBlindness - Color Blindness Library for [Processing](http://processing.org)

[Processing](http://processing.org) is an open source Java application used by students and artists to explore creative expression of technology. I very much enjoy creative coding and I often use Processing to implement my ideas.

[Processing](http://processing.org) allows users to contribute to its continued development by making libraries to extend its functionality. ColorBlindness is one such library extension that I created that provides users with the ability to approximate what a color deficient viewer would see.

ColorBlindness provides two color transformation algorithms. The first simulates color blindness, and the second does a color blindness correction called daltonization. Both are implemented in a way that is easy for beginners to use. More advanced users can also create their own custom color transformation or correction algorithms.

My goals for this library are:

* Easy to use tools for simulating color blindness. This will allow artists and creative coders to consider the needs of color blind individuals in their designs. The implementation is FAST and will not significantly slow down the frame rate of a sketch.
* Interactive and educational visualizations for understanding color blindness.

My hope is for this library to help educate the Processing community about color blindness and to create new opportunities for artistic expression.
